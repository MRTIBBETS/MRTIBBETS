My name is Alexander Tibbets. I like to build things, tell stories, and help people.

[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) is an app I co-founded that lets you connect all the things in your life, on your terms.

Today I help startups launch, pivot, and grow their business.

Often as a fractional or interim leader. Especially within media technology and developer tools.
